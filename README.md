### *2021 GENERAL ELECTION*
# HONDURAS
——————————————————————————————————
> Honduras has just completed its 2021 General Election. This campaign has been a pivotal, nation-defining moment in its history. As it has attempted to recover from the 2009 military coup d'teat of Pink Tide President Manuel Zelaya, and a devastating austerity regime implemented by the ruling conservative *Partido Nacional* that has further crippled the nation's economy as it attempts to fight perenially high crime rates admist the War on Drugs, a number of new political players have emerged as fighters on the national scene. Former President Zelaya's wife, Former First Lady Xiomara Castro, won the nomination of the *Libre*, a new offshoot party with roots in Bolivarianism and an alignment with the São Paulo Forum and distinctly Chavista principles. Additionally, the populist, anti-corruption *Partido Salvador* nominated its founder, Sr. Salvador Nasralla, who, in the polls, looked like a legitimate contender before dropping out of the race at the last minute to assume the role of Sra. Castro's running mate admist an electoral deal. Finally, the ruling *Partido Nacional* nominated Tegulcigalpa Mayor Nasry Asfura as its candidate, who broadly ran on continuity of the prior Administration. The polls going into Election Night showed a narrow lead for *Libre* — but also a large number of undecided voters, and as the electorate weighed their choices of a return to the Pink Tide — a continuation of the status quo — and the centrist *Partido Liberal*, the winner remained shrouded in contest.
